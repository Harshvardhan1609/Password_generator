Hello Guys! In this project, there are 2 aspects 
1) easy mode = all the  numbers are together and letters and symbols are together
2) hard mode  =  all the numbers, symbols, and letters are randomized.

here we have used some of the bestest combination of random module with the for loops and lists .
Do not forget to push your upgraded version 
Thanks everyone
Enjoy !
